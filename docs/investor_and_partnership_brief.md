# 💼 FlowBridge — Investor & Partnership Brief

> Building the next-generation real-time payment network for banks, blockchains, and businesses.

## Executive Summary

FlowBridge is a ZK Sync–powered real-time settlement network connecting traditional banking infrastructure with tokenized digital cash.

Mission: Make global payments instantaneous, compliant, and programmable — upgrading banks rather than replacing them.

## The Problem

- Settlement latency (ACH 1–3 days)
- Manual reconciliation overhead
- Fragmented systems across bank/fintech/crypto
- Compliance overhead and siloed tooling

## The Solution — FlowBridge

| Layer | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Smart Contracts (ZK Sync) | Trustless settlement, escrow, tokenized cash |
| Payment Orchestrator | Event streaming between banks and chains |
| Compliance AI Engine | Automated reconciliation and anomaly reporting |
| API Gateway | OAuth2-secured entry for banks, fintechs, developers |

Avg settlement: 2–3 seconds. Assurance: cryptographically verifiable.

## Business Model

- API transaction fees (2–5 bps)
- Enterprise SaaS licenses ($10k–$50k/mo)
- White-label deployments (custom)
- Data & analytics APIs (usage-based)

## Strategic Partners (Targets)

- Fintech: Stripe, Plaid, Alloy
- Stablecoins: Circle (USDC), PayPal (PYUSD)
- Custody/Exchanges: Coinbase, Fireblocks
- Audit/RegTech: Deloitte, Chainalysis

## Competitive Edge

- Real-time settlement on zkRollups (<3s)
- Compliance-first design with AI reconciliation
- Interoperability with existing bank APIs
- Kafka-based scalability + microservices
- Security posture: formal verification + Vault/KMS + mTLS

## Traction (MVP)
